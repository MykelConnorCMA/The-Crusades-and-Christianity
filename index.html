                                    Overall there are three major monotheistic religions: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Though despite believing in the same "God", they have largely distinctive features. One of which is their messiah: Jews are still awaiting a messiah, Jesus is the christian messiah, and Muhamed is the lead prophet for Islam. The Muslims, however, are not awaiting a messiah, they believe that the closest thing they will get is the great prophet—Muhammed. Christianity, out of these three, is in the middle when it comes to age, in fact one could say it came from Judaism. Though, Christianity, specifically, is not near as prominent here in the middle east as Judaism or Islam, however that changes when you move to Europe and the Americas.

                                    To delve more into the Christian faith's history, one would likely find that in christianity's roman days, the faith was at first persecuted, but eventually made their primary religion. Later down the line, the Christian Church was split in two over a creed made by the Eastern Church without the West's consent. Thus, they cut ties and were known as the Roman Catholic Church for the west, and the Christian Orthodox Church for the east The two churches are split even to this day. Even now, Rome has a large number of christians, being the international center of Catholicism, seeing as it houses the Pope—Jesus' representative.

                                    As for how Christianity is seen by the other primary monotheistic faiths—Islam and Judaism—it is seen as an enemy when it comes to the Middle East, but their beliefs say that they should exist peacefully. When looking through Islam's perspective, Christianity is full of great people with only one sin taking them from their perceived salvation—their messiah, Jesus Christ. This is strange considering how harshly muslims view the jews. As for the Jewish perspective of Christianity, It is looked upon with shame, for the Bible even says that it was the jews that ordered Jesus' death.

                                    The Crusades, in summary, are the Roman Catholic Church's attempts to retake the holy land from the Muslims; who were starting to grow immensely. Only one of these crusades was an actual success. In fact, at one point, the Roman Catholic Church sent in children to raid the muslims thinking they would not be hurt because they were kids, however the few that made it were brutally murdered. Also, there was a crusade that ended up going so far off its primary mission that the soldiers all became mercenaries, even attacking a holy city in the end. Put simply, the crusades were, for the most part, an utter failure.

                                    The First Crusade's goal was to get the Seljuk Turks out of the holy land. However, like most wars at the time, there must be soldiers willing to fight. Thus, the Pope gave a speech denouncing the Seljuks and promoting the cause. Another person that helped promote the crusade was in Germany, his name was Peter the Hermit. Despite their efforts, the soldiers enlisted by both the Pope and Peter were unable to make it to Jerusalem to start battle. Thus, the first crusade was a complete failure.

                                    The Second Crusade was a response to Edessa's cry for help. It did not take long for many to respond hoping to right the first crusade's failure. Though, just as in the first crusade, the soldiers were unable to take back both Edessa and Damascus. Now, the Church has failed two crusades.

                                    The Third Crusade was a crusade that was almost won. Though, it is best said through the phrase, “we won the battle, but not the war”. This is the best way of putting it because that one battle that was won by the Christians may have not been very important in the war, but helped increase morale for the next crusade.
                                </p>

                                    The Fourth Crusade, overall, was the worst failure of the first four crusades. Before the fighting could even begin, the soldiers were a third in their number. On top of that, they did not have the money to pay for the necessary provisions. Thus, they became mercenaries so they could continue their battle, though they quite return to their original objective.
